# AutomateGoogleCalendar

Imagine having to create over a thousand individual events with different name, location, start time, end time and description in your team's Google Calendar. This can be a a tedious and very time consuming task. Are you looking for a smarter and more effective way to get the paperwork done? 

___Then look no further! AutomateGoogleCalendar is the tool you need!___

 

This project utilises Selenium to scrap data on soccer events from http://www.tsisports.ca/. Then, it combines ressources from Google RESTful API (Google Sheet API and Google Calendar API) to create events in your own Google Calendar. 




For demo purposes:
Run command "python delete_events.py" in the command line to erase all the events created by event_creator.py
Then run command "python event_creator.py" to create all the events in Google Calendar.
